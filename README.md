## smaf4dec: Social Media App for Defeating Echochambers

This project is created with the intention of bursting echochambers and facilitating substantiated social media interactions. The idea was generated at NYC Coder's "Hack for #BlackLivesMatter" hackathon on June 11th-14th of 2020, with the repo being named smaf4dec (Social Media App for Defeating Echo Chambers) and the MVP being named De-Echo. The hackathon team that created the MVP included Calvin Goah, Reese Bowman, Arianna Choza, Donovan Richardson, and our tech shadow, Sanket Patnaik. We also had excellent guidance from our hackathon PM, Omar Jameer, and our hackathon designer, Marisa Ruiz Asari. Since then, the project has undergone some major conceptual, visionary, and branding changes geared towards becoming a viable product called Revrb. We're currently exploring ways to turn this into an open source project powered by the GitHub community.

## The Problem
Current social media algorithms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) are trained to learn what a user likes, leading to suggestions of more likable content. This is a slippery slope that could lead to the prevalence of echochambers within certain social media sites. Most users readily accept what they see on their social media feeds without doing any research of their own to verify, then assume that their perspective is the most accurate

## The Solution
1. Provide a platform that shows the reverberations/effects people’s comments have on those on the other side of the divide, while presenting referential information to users
1. Create a chat interaction where in order for users to interact they must provide links to their arguments.
1. Be a source of reliable social media content, that can easily be docked—either via a chrome extension or other medium—into a user’s current social media platform
1. If a post has a Revrb symbol on it, users should know that we’ve connected it to other information on the web
1. If it has a Revrb score—based on the volume of information on that content—users should be able to better inform themselves on the trustworthiness of the content
1. Explore the use of blockchain technology to maintain an open ledger of verifiable social media content
