## social media app for defeating echochambers

This app is created with the intention of bursting echochambers. Current social media algorithms( twitter, facebook, instagram) are trained to learn what a user likes and suggest more like-able content. This is a slippery slope towards ending up in echochambers, never hearing opposing viewpoints, and never having one's opinions challenged.

de - Echo takes a user's twitter account<!--, finds hashtags--> and generates an opposite feed so users can be aware of their bias / echochambers, and see what they are missing and hopefully challenge and inform their views.
