## social media app for defeating echochambers

This app is created with the intention of bursting echochambers. Current social media algorhythms( twitter, facebook, instagram) are trained to learn what a user likes and suggest more like content. This is a slippery sloap towards ending up in echochambers, never hearing opposing view points or users' opinions being challenged,

de - Echo takes users twitter account, finds hashtags and generates an opposite feed so user can be aware of their bais / echochamer and see what they are missing and hopefully challenge and inform their views.
